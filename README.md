# Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes
In this repo I demonstrated how to build a simple sms spam filter using multinomial naive bayes.

The dataset used here was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo and it can be downloaded from the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection'>The UCI Machine Learning Repository<a/>.

To build this spam filter we will be working with pandas which is a python library for data analysis and we we will also be using the gradio library to build a simple web interface to launch and test the algorithm.

You can download both libraries with a simple pip command.
i.e `pip install pandas` and `pip install gradio`
